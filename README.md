# 🌐 Front End learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Front End playground! This repository is where I explore, experiment, and grow my skills in building beautiful, responsive and interactive websites.

## 🚀 What I'm learning

- **HTML** – Structuring the web
- **CSS** – Styling with flair
- **JavaScript** – Making things interactive
- **Responsive Design** – Mobile-first and adaptive layouts
- **Frameworks** – Starting with basics, then diving into React, Vue, or others
- **Version Control** – Git and GitHub for collaboration and tracking

- ## 📁 Folder Structure

You'll find organized folders for each topic or project:

- html-basics/
- css-practice/
- js-exercises/
- mini-projects/

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

I'm using this space to:
- Practice what I learn from tutorials and courses
- Build mini-projects to reinforce concepts
- Track my growth and share progress with others

## 💡 Goals

- Build a portfolio-worthy project by the end of the year
- Master responsive design techniques
- Being knowledgable to programming languages (HTML,CSS,JavaScript)
- Explore at least one front-end framework
